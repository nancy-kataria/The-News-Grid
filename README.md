# The News Grid

The News Grid is a dynamic news website built using React. It displays the latest news from various categories, providing users with a quick and efficient way to stay updated. This project was one of my earlist projects which helped me learn React and API integration.

## Features
- Display the latest news articles categorized by topics.
- Simple and clean user interface.
- API integration to fetch real-time news data.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and logic.
- **Axios**: To handle API requests.
- **NewsCatcher API**: For fetching news data.

## Learning Experience
This project was one of my first React applications. Through building The News Grid, I gained valuable experience in:
- Understanding React's component-based architecture.
- Integrating APIs using Axios.
- Working with state and props in React.
- Styling components using CSS.

## Hosting
The project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. However, due to a policy change by NewsCatcher (making it a paid service), the website currently does not display content. Despite this limitation, the code and structure of the application demonstrate its functionality and design.

## Installation and Setup
If you'd like to explore the code or run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository:
